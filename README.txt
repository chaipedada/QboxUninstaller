Qbox Uninstaller Application

It does the following:

Open a Main window with the following options:

a. Uninstall Qbox Client Program

b. Uninstall Qbox Client Program and system data files

Then,

Once the option is selected, it goes to a second screen as specified in the requirements doc which asks are you sure and explains the repercussions of uninstalling and gives the option of Yes or No.

Then, if yes is selected, the screen closes, then it will launch the uninstall which will be either OKed or canceled by the User.

If the uninstall fails for whatever reason (if files were open etc.), it sends a message to close all files and try to uninstall again and returns to the Main Window. 

If the uninstall succeeds, then it opens a screen that recommends to restart the machine and gives two options: restart or restart later which the user again chooses.
